Hello there! I like programming.

Topics of interest, in no particular order:

- Low-level systems programming (e.g. keyboard firmware)
- Performance (hand-writing assembly and using SIMD)
- System architecture (expressing meaning through code)
- Programming languages ("can we make Rust better?")
- Compilers (specifically, optimizing with equality saturation)
- Operating systems (system APIs, `io_uring`, microkernels)
- Instruction set architectures (writing an ISA for modern CPUs)
- Networking protocols (simplifying TLS, rewriting IRC)
- Privacy and security (cryptography in communication)
- Morality and ethics in technology and programming

Programming languages of preference: Rust and/or C.
